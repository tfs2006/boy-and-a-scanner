    <h2>P25 Basics (Plain English)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>P25 Conventional:</strong> One agency stays on one frequency. You can program it like a normal
        channel.</li>
      <li><strong>P25 Trunked:</strong> One system uses many frequencies. The <strong>control channel</strong> tells the
        radios where to go for each conversation (talkgroup).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Terms you’ll see:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>System:</strong> The overall trunked network (county/state system).</li>
        <li><strong>Site:</strong> A tower/cell you receive (often the most important part).</li>
        <li><strong>Talkgroup (TGID):</strong> A “channel” on trunking (Police Dispatch, Fire Tac, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>ID Search vs ID Scan:</strong> Search = discover all TGs, Scan = only TGs you saved.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Step-by-Step: P25 Trunked (Most Common Public Safety)</h2>
    <p><strong>You need:</strong> the correct site frequencies for the tower you can receive (control channel /
      alternate control channels). Talkgroups are optional if you start in ID Search.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Create a Favorites List</strong>: MENU → Manage Favorites → New Favorites List.</li>
      <li><strong>New system:</strong> Open that list → Review/Edit System → New System → <strong>P25 Trunk</strong> →
        name it.</li>
      <li><strong>Add a site:</strong> Edit Site → New Site → name it (closest site/tower).</li>
      <li><strong>Enter site frequencies:</strong> Edit Site → Set Frequencies → enter the listed control/voice
        frequencies for that site.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose mode:</strong> Start with <strong>ID Search</strong> to discover active TGs. Switch to
        <strong>ID Scan</strong> once you’ve saved what you want.</li>
      <li><strong>Add departments/talkgroups (optional):</strong> Edit Department → New Department → Edit Channel → New
        Channel (enter TGIDs you want for a clean setup).</li>
      <li><strong>Scan and refine:</strong> Use Avoid/Hold to clean up, and confirm you’re receiving the best site.</li>
    </ol>

  <section class="card" id="one-frequency" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2>Step-by-Step: P25 One-Frequency (Digital on a Single Channel)</h2>
    <p><strong>You need:</strong> one frequency. This is common for smaller agencies or special-use channels.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>MENU → Manage Favorites → select list → Review/Edit System → New System → <strong>P25 One Frequency</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>Edit Department → New Department → name it.</li>
      <li>Edit Channel → New Channel → enter the frequency → set name.</li>
      <li>Scan and verify decode. If audio is broken, improve signal quality (move/antenna) or verify it isn’t
        encrypted.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="sentinel" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2>Sentinel vs Manual: Fastest Path for P25</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sentinel (recommended):</strong> Easiest way to pull correct systems/sites from the database, then
        write a clean Favorites List.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual (on-radio):</strong> Best for quick edits, quick holds, and field programming when you already
        know the correct data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">If you’re on Windows, start with the <a href="/sds100-sentinel-programming.html">Sentinel guide</a>
      and then use this page to understand what matters for P25 (sites, control channels, and ID Search/Scan).</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card" id="troubleshooting" style="margin-top:18px">
    <h2>Troubleshooting: “Nothing to Scan”, No Audio, and Bad Decode</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nothing to Scan:</strong> Check Service Types, Quick Keys, Avoids, and Location Control.</li>
      <li><strong>Wrong site:</strong> If you programmed the wrong site, the system may show nothing or stop with no
        voice. Confirm the nearest/strongest site.</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encrypted talkgroups can’t be monitored (you may see activity with no
        intelligible audio).</li>
      <li><strong>Simulcast distortion:</strong> Try small moves and a smaller 700/800 MHz antenna; see the simulcast
        guide for step-by-step fixes.</li>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Do I need an upgrade key for P25 on the SDS100?</summary>
      <p>No. APCO P25 Phase I and Phase II are included on the SDS100. Optional upgrade keys are for formats like DMR,
        NXDN, and ProVoice.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What is a P25 control channel and why does it matter?</summary>
      <p>On a P25 trunked system, the control channel is a continuously-transmitting data channel that tells radios (and
        scanners) what voice frequency to tune to for each talkgroup. If you don’t have the correct site/control channel
        data, trunk tracking usually won’t work.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What’s the difference between ID Scan and ID Search on the SDS100?</summary>
      <p>ID Search lets you hear/discover any active talkgroup on the system. ID Scan restricts audio to only the
        talkgroups you saved. Use ID Search to explore, then switch to ID Scan for a clean, focused setup.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Why do I see talkgroup activity but hear no audio on P25?</summary>
      <p>The most common cause is encryption. If a talkgroup is encrypted, the SDS100 cannot decode intelligible audio.
        Other causes include weak/garbled decode (simulcast), wrong site frequencies, or scanning restrictions (service
        types, avoids, quick keys).</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do I improve P25 simulcast decoding on the SDS100?</summary>
      <p>Start with physical changes: move the radio a few feet, try a smaller 700/800 MHz antenna, and avoid high-gain
        wideband antennas indoors. If needed, lock onto the best site and review safe settings like attenuation.</p>
