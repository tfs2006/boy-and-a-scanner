    <h2>Quick setup (low-friction checklist)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Charge fully and power on.</li>
      <li>Do a quick location-based scan while stationary, then test again while moving (GPS-based scanning is the
        point).</li>
      <li>Install Sentinel on Windows and do a database update (Uniden mentions weekly updates via Sentinel).</li>
      <li>Create a small Favorites List for your core systems so you can toggle what you want quickly.</li>
      <li>If you’re in simulcast areas, treat antenna choice/placement as part of setup (see the <a
          href="/sds100-simulcast-guide.html">Simulcast Fix Guide</a>).</li>

    <h2>Ready to buy?</h2>
    <p>When you buy the SDS150, you’re buying more than coverage—you’re buying <strong>less friction</strong>: less
      cable mess, less “where am I scanning,” and more time actually listening.</p>
