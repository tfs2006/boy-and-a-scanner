      <h2>ProVoice Basics (Plain English)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ProVoice is a voice format</strong> used on some EDACS trunked systems.</li>
        <li>The SDS100 can track EDACS systems, but it needs the <strong>ProVoice upgrade</strong> to decode ProVoice voice.</li>
        <li><strong>EDACS uses LCN order</strong>: each frequency must be placed into the correct channel number position.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout warning">
        <strong>Before you start:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm <strong>ProVoice upgrade</strong> is enabled: MENU → Settings → Upgrade (ProVoice should show enabled).</li>
          <li>Confirm your target is still <strong>EDACS</strong>. Many systems have migrated to P25.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step: Program EDACS ProVoice on the SDS100</h2>
      <p><strong>You need:</strong> EDACS system type, the correct site frequencies, and the correct <strong>LCN order</strong>. If you don’t have LCNs, RadioReference is the fastest path.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Create a Favorites List</strong> (if needed): MENU → Manage Favorites → New Favorites List.</li>
        <li><strong>New system:</strong> Open that Favorites List → Review/Edit System → New System → choose the EDACS system type for your target.</li>
        <li><strong>Edit Site → Set Frequencies:</strong> Enter each frequency into its correct <strong>LCN slot</strong> (LCN 01, LCN 02, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Add talkgroups:</strong> Create a Department and add Talkgroup IDs (or use ID Search to discover active ones).</li>
        <li><strong>Scan and refine:</strong> Name and avoid what you don’t want, then switch from discovery to focused scanning.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="callout warning">
        <strong>Most common mistake:</strong> entering EDACS frequencies out of LCN order. Even if you have all the right frequencies, the wrong order breaks tracking.

    <section class="card" id="sentinel" style="margin-top:18px">
      <h2>Sentinel vs Manual: Which is Better for ProVoice?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentinel (recommended):</strong> Easier to build and maintain Favorites Lists, and cleaner to edit LCN order without mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual (on-radio):</strong> Possible, but more error-prone for EDACS because LCN order must be perfect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">If you’re using a PC, start with the <a href="/sds100-sentinel-programming.html">Sentinel guide</a> for the general workflow, then use this page for ProVoice specifics.</p>

    <section class="card" id="troubleshooting" style="margin-top:18px">
      <h2>Troubleshooting: ProVoice “No Audio” and Tracking Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> If the talkgroup is encrypted, you may see activity but you won’t hear intelligible audio.</li>
        <li><strong>LCN order:</strong> Re-check every frequency is in the correct LCN slot for EDACS.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrong system type:</strong> EDACS Wide vs Narrow matters depending on the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrong site or incomplete frequencies:</strong> Make sure you entered the site you can actually receive.</li>
        <li><strong>What’s enabled:</strong> Check Quick Keys, Avoids, and that the Favorites List/System/Department is enabled to scan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">If you see “Nothing to Scan,” it’s usually Quick Keys, Avoids, or Service Types—see the <a href="/sds100-sentinel-programming.html">Sentinel guide</a> for the clean fix sequence.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details open>
        <summary>Does the SDS100 need the ProVoice upgrade to listen to ProVoice?</summary>
        <p>Yes. The Uniden SDS100 requires the optional ProVoice upgrade key to decode EDACS ProVoice voice traffic.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What do I need to program an EDACS ProVoice system on the SDS100?</summary>
        <p>You need the correct EDACS system type, all site frequencies, and the correct Logical Channel Number (LCN) order. LCN order is critical for EDACS tracking. Talkgroups help you focus, but you can often start with ID Search to discover active groups.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Why does my SDS100 stop on EDACS talkgroups but I hear no audio?</summary>
        <p>Common causes include encryption on that talkgroup, a wrong EDACS system type, incorrect or missing LCN order, or the wrong site/frequencies for your area. Also check Avoids/Quick Keys/Service Types so the scanner is actually scanning your ProVoice system.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How important is LCN order for EDACS ProVoice?</summary>
        <p>Very important. EDACS requires frequencies to be entered in the correct LCN positions; a single swapped channel can prevent proper tracking.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can the SDS100 monitor encrypted ProVoice?</summary>
        <p>No. If a ProVoice talkgroup is encrypted, the SDS100 cannot decode intelligible audio. You may see activity, but you won’t hear clear voice.</p>
      </details>
