            <h2>What is a 700/800 MHz Stubby Antenna?</h2>
            <p>A 700/800 MHz stubby antenna is a band-specific antenna optimized for the 700-900 MHz frequency range. The most popular model for the Uniden SDS100 and SDS150 is the <strong>Remtronix REM-820S</strong>, which delivers +6dB gain over the stock wideband antenna on these critical public safety bands.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Most modern P25 Phase I/II trunked public safety systems operate on 700/800 MHz. A band-tuned antenna dramatically improves reception, decode reliability, and coverage range compared to the compromise wideband stock antenna.

            <h2>When This Antenna Works Best</h2>
            <ul class="nice">
                <li><strong>P25 Trunked Systems (700/800 MHz):</strong> The primary use case - dramatically improves reception on modern public safety trunked networks</li>
                <li><strong>Simulcast Environments:</strong> Better signal strength helps the SDS100's True I/Q receiver decode simulcast systems more reliably</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Signal Areas:</strong> The +6dB gain extends your monitoring range significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Scanning:</strong> Cuts through interference better than wideband antennas in congested RF environments</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial UHF (450-470 MHz):</strong> Also performs well on UHF business bands</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="card" style="margin-top:16px;">
                <h3>Will the 820S work on VHF?</h3>
                <p>No. The 820S is designed for 700-900 MHz and performs poorly on VHF-high (150-174 MHz) and airband (108-137 MHz). For VHF, use the stock antenna or a VHF-specific antenna like a telescoping whip.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>How much better is it than the stock antenna?</h3>
                <p>The 820S delivers minimum +6dB gain on 700-900 MHz compared to the stock antenna. In practical terms, this means significantly stronger signals, better decode rates, and extended range - many users report receiving departments they couldn't hear before.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Will it help with simulcast distortion?</h3>
                <p>Yes, indirectly. The SDS100's True I/Q receiver does the heavy lifting for simulcast, but the 820S provides stronger signals which give the receiver better data to work with. This often results in improved decode reliability in simulcast environments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Is the 820S waterproof?</h3>
                <p>The 820S includes an O-ring that maintains the SDS100/SDS150's water resistance rating. It's weather-resistant but not fully waterproof - same as the scanner itself.</p>
