            <h2>What is the Stock Wideband Rubber Duck Antenna?</h2>
            <p>The stock wideband rubber duck antenna is the flexible, short antenna that comes included with both the Uniden SDS100 and SDS150 handheld scanners. It's designed as a compromise antenna that covers the scanner's full frequency range (25-1300 MHz) with reasonable performance.</p>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Wideband antennas trade efficiency for coverage. The stock antenna will never outperform a band-specific antenna on any single band, but it provides adequate reception across all bands when convenience matters most.

        <!-- Best Use Cases -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>When the Stock Antenna Works Best</h2>
            <p>The stock wideband rubber duck antenna excels in specific scanning scenarios:</p>
            <ul class="nice">
                <li><strong>Mixed "Everything" Scanning:</strong> When you want to scan across multiple bands (VHF, UHF, 700/800 MHz) simultaneously without swapping antennas</li>
                <li><strong>Portability is Priority:</strong> Perfect for on-the-go scanning where a compact, durable antenna matters more than maximum performance</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Local Signals:</strong> Works adequately when monitoring nearby transmitters with strong signals</li>
                <li><strong>General Discovery Scanning:</strong> Good for exploring what's active in your area across all bands</li>
                <li><strong>Casual Monitoring:</strong> Ideal for occasional scanning or when performance isn't critical</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Compatibility with Systems -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2>Compatibility with Analog, P25, DMR, and NXDN</h2>
            <p>The stock antenna works identically across all modulation types—the antenna doesn't know or care whether the signal is analog or digital:</p>
            
            <div class="grid cols-2">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Analog FM/AM</h3>
                    <p>Works fine for strong analog signals. Conventional channels with good signal strength will be clear. Weak signals may suffer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>P25 Phase I/II</h3>
                    <p>Adequate for P25 systems with strong signals. In simulcast environments, signal quality matters more—weak or multipath signals may cause "digital cliff" dropout.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>DMR</h3>
                    <p>Similar to P25—works when signals are strong. The wideband design means it won't optimize for specific UHF DMR frequencies.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>NXDN</h3>
                    <p>Functions acceptably for NXDN systems. Again, performance depends on signal strength, not the digital mode.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="callout">
                <strong>Remember:</strong> Digital modes (P25/DMR/NXDN) punish weak or multipath signals more harshly than analog. The "digital cliff" means you either get clear audio or nothing. Band-tuned antennas improve decode reliability by pulling in stronger signals.

            <h2>When Should You Upgrade?</h2>
            <p>Consider upgrading from the stock antenna if you experience:</p>
            <ul class="nice">
                <li><strong>Poor 700/800 MHz Performance:</strong> Upgrade to a Remtronix 820S or similar 800 MHz-tuned antenna for dramatically better trunked system reception</li>
                <li><strong>Simulcast Distortion:</strong> A band-specific antenna can help, though the SDS100's True I/Q receiver does most of the heavy lifting</li>
                <li><strong>Weak VHF/Airband Signals:</strong> A telescoping whip antenna adjusted to VHF length improves reception significantly</li>
                <li><strong>Home/Fixed Location Use:</strong> An outdoor discone or base antenna provides massive improvement over any handheld antenna</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Band Focus:</strong> If you primarily monitor one band, a tuned antenna outperforms wideband every time</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="card" style="margin-top:16px;">
                <h3>Is the stock antenna good enough?</h3>
                <p>For strong local signals and casual scanning, yes. If you're in a challenging RF environment, monitoring weak/distant systems, or focusing on specific bands, upgrading will provide noticeably better performance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Why does my stock antenna perform poorly on 800 MHz?</h3>
                <p>Wideband antennas compromise efficiency for coverage. The stock antenna isn't optimized for any specific band, so it underperforms compared to a band-specific antenna like the Remtronix 820S which is tuned specifically for 700/800 MHz.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Can I use the stock antenna for simulcast P25 systems?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but performance depends more on the SDS100's True I/Q receiver than the antenna. That said, a stronger signal from a tuned antenna can help the scanner decode simulcast signals more reliably.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>What's the best all-around upgrade from the stock antenna?</h3>
                <p>It depends on what you monitor most. For 700/800 MHz P25 systems (most common public safety), get a Remtronix 820S. For VHF/airband, get a telescoping whip. For home use covering all bands, install an outdoor discone.</p>
