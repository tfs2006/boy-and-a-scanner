    <h1>Manual Programming NXDN Systems</h1>
    <p>Add conventional and trunked NXDN systems to your SDS100 and monitor public‑safety and business users.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>NXDN is a digital radio protocol used by many public‑safety agencies and commercial operators. Like DMR, it requires an optional upgrade key on the SDS100【252690829170062†L0-L0】. After activating the NXDN option you can manually enter both conventional and trunked NXDN systems directly on the scanner.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An Uniden SDS100 with the NXDN upgrade installed</li>
      <li>Frequencies used by the NXDN system (control channels for trunked systems, or voice channels for conventional)</li>
      <li>RAN (Radio Access Number) values for each channel if required</li>
      <li>Talkgroup IDs or channel names</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Create or select a Favorites List:</strong> From the main menu select <em>Manage Favorites → Review/Edit System</em>. Choose a list to add your NXDN system or create a new one.</li>
      <li><strong>Add a new system:</strong> Choose <em>New System</em> and scroll until you find the NXDN system type. If your scanner has the upgrade, options such as <em>NXDN Trunk</em> and <em>NXDN One Frequency</em> will appear. Select the appropriate type and give the system a name.</li>
      <li><strong>Enter sites and frequencies:</strong> For trunked NXDN systems, create a site and input all control‑channel frequencies. Some NXDN networks use numerical LCNs similar to DMR; consult local documentation. For conventional channels, simply enter the frequency and RAN code if necessary.</li>
      <li><strong>Add departments and talkgroups:</strong> Create a department and add each talkgroup ID you wish to monitor, assigning descriptive tags. For conventional channels, each channel entry can include a label and RAN.</li>
      <li><strong>Save and begin monitoring:</strong> Exit out of the menus and ensure your new Favorites List is enabled in scan mode. Your SDS100 will now follow the NXDN system.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Because NXDN systems can vary widely in configuration, it’s helpful to research the specific network you’re monitoring. Use online resources such as RadioReference to find RAN codes and talkgroup assignments. As with DMR, you can add new talkgroups on the fly or adjust priority and alert settings for channels you need to hear immediately.</p>
