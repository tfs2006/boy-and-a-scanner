    <h1>Manual Programming P25 Systems</h1>
    <p>Create P25 trunked or conventional systems on your SDS100 without a computer.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The SDS100 can decode APCO P25 digital communications out of the box. While most users rely on Sentinel software to import systems from the RadioReference database, you can also build systems manually using the scanner’s front panel. This is useful when the database is incomplete or when you need to quickly add a new talkgroup or frequency while you’re on the go.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Uniden SDS100 scanner</li>
      <li>System details: control‑channel frequencies for a trunked system, or individual channel frequencies for a one‑frequency system</li>
      <li>Talkgroup IDs (TGIDs) or channel names</li>
      <li>The NAC code for conventional P25 channels if known (optional)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Create or select a Favorites List:</strong> Press <em>Menu</em>, scroll to <em>Manage Favorites</em> and choose <em>Review/Edit System</em>. Select an existing Favorites List or highlight <em>New Favorites List</em> and press <em>E/yes</em> to create one. Give it a descriptive name such as “Local P25”.</li>
      <li><strong>Add a new system:</strong> With your Favorites List highlighted, choose <em>New System</em>. When prompted for the system type, rotate the scroll knob until you see <em>P25 Trunk</em> for trunked systems or <em>P25 One Frequency</em> for conventional channels. Press <em>E/yes</em> to select【2248†2262】. Enter a name for the system (e.g. “State Police”).</li>
      <li><strong>Add a site (trunked only):</strong> For a P25 trunked system you’ll be prompted to create a site. Enter a site name and then input the control‑channel frequencies. The SDS100 will automatically determine voice channels when scanning.</li>
      <li><strong>Add departments and talkgroups:</strong> After creating the system and site, choose <em>Add Department</em>. Name the department (perhaps by county or agency). Then select <em>Add Channel</em> and input each talkgroup ID along with an alpha tag. Repeat for each talkgroup you wish to monitor. For conventional P25 channels, enter the frequency and NAC if known.</li>
      <li><strong>Save and scan:</strong> When you’ve entered all TGIDs or channels, press <em>Menu</em> repeatedly until you return to the main scan screen. Make sure the Favorites List is enabled. The scanner will now track the P25 system you created.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Manual programming gives you fine‑grained control over what you monitor. After creating your system you can adjust options such as priority, alert tones and service types. If you later import the same agency via Sentinel, you can compare the database programming against your custom list to fill any gaps.</p>
