    <p>Hi, I'm the voice behind Boy And A Scanner. I started this project as a way to share my passion for radio scanning and help others get started. What began as a hobby has grown into a community of enthusiasts who love discovering what’s happening around them.</p>
    <p>Our YouTube channel covers topics like programming the Uniden SDS100, building antennas, finding hidden frequencies and streaming your scanner online. This website expands on those videos with written guides, tips and affiliate gear recommendations.</p>
    <p>Thank you for joining the community—get your freq on!</p>
